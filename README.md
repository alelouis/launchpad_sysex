# Launchpad X SysEx Programming
SysEx messages to Launchpad X

The example script shows how to send SysEx messages to a Launchpad X in order to program the individual leds in an RGB manner. 
The script creates fading gaussian blobs where the launchpad is hit, and the color is mapped to velocity via a matplotlib cmap.
